# RISCy: A Logisim-Based RISC-V CPU

RISCy is a fully functional RISC-V CPU implemented from scratch using Logisim, a digital logic simulator.
This project showcases the design and construction of a simplified RISC-V architecture, including essential components like the ALU, branch comparator, control logic, immediate generator, memory, partial load, partial store, and register file.

## Components
RISCy consists of the following key components:

**ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic and logic operations.

**Branch Comparator:** Handles branch instructions and conditional jumps.

**Control Logic:** Manages the flow of instructions and control signals.

**Immediate Generator:** Generates immediate values for certain instruction types.

**Memory:** Stores data and instructions.

**Partial Load and Store Units:** Facilitate loading and storing of data from/to memory.

**Register File:** Stores and manages the CPU's registers.
